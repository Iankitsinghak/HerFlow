🌸 HerFlow — Where Science Meets Softness, and Wellness Meets You
HerFlow is not just a period tracker —
it is a calm, intelligent, privacy-first companion crafted for women who deserve clarity, comfort, and confidence in understanding their body.
It blends:
✨ cycle intelligence,
✨ AI support,
✨ community warmth,
✨ Indian wellness context,
✨ scientific accuracy,
✨ and gentle design
—into a single, beautiful progressive web app.
Every pixel, every interaction, every insight is created in service of one goal:
to help women feel seen, supported, and understood.
🌷 Why HerFlow Exists
Most health apps today feel clinical, noisy, or overwhelming.
HerFlow was created as a soft, safe ecosystem, built around:
trust (your data stays with you),
comfort (no triggering language or judgment),
warmth (design that feels like a friend),
clarity (understanding your cycle should never feel complicated).
HerFlow is for the modern, conscious woman — and for every cycle story.
